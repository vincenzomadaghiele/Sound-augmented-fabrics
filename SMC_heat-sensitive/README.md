# Heat-sensitive sonic textiles: fostering awareness of the energy we save by
wearing warm fabrics

### Abstract:
In this paper we describe the development of two heat and movement-sensitive sonic textile prototypes. The two prototypes are built using the same electronics and sound designs, but they differ in shape and material, prompting different interactions and use cases. The aim of these prototypes is to complement, through sonic interactions, the experience of keeping a person's body warm, and to stimulate awareness of heat exchanges between the body, the fabric, and the surrounding environment. 

After describing the design rationale and the technical development of the prototypes - in terms of textile fabrication, electronic and sound components - we discuss the results of two user experiments. In the first experiment, two different sonification approaches were evaluated allowing us to select the most appropriate for the task. We used the second experiment to evaluate the prototypes' use-experience. Having two prototypes with different shapes allowed us to discuss how the sonic, tactile and physical aspects of the artifacts blend or contrast, giving rise to differences in interpretation and perception when experiencing the two sonic objects.
