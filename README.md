# Sound-augmented fabrics

This repository contains the code and information about the sound-augmented fabric prototypes that have been developed in the context of the Sounds for Energy project. 

The project led to a publication:

> Vincenzo Madaghiele, Sandra Pauletto.
> [**Experimenting techniques for sonic implicit interactions: a real time sonification of body-textile heat exchange with sound augmented fabrics**](https://zenodo.org/record/7243805#.Y1Z0FlJBy3I).
> In _Proceedings of 2nd Conference on Sonification of Health and Environmental Data (SoniHED)_, October 27-28 2022, Stockholm (SE).
