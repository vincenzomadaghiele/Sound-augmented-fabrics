### Abstract:
In this paper we present our prototype of a sound augmented blanket. With this artifact we aim to investigate the potential to achieve sonic implicit interaction through auditory augmentation of fabrics. We describe the development of a blanket that sonifies the approximate temperature exchange between the body and the fabric, using sound as a medium of interaction and a carrier of information. We propose different methods for auditory augmentation of fabrics through a piezoelectric contact microphone used for movement sensing. After describing the technical development of the prototype, we discuss our early findings from a qualitative standpoint, focusing on the process of sense-making of such an artifact from an evaluation based on free exploration. 
Our initial results suggest that different auditory augmentation models encourage different use cases, and are able to provide a simple creative and aesthetic experience. The ability of the chosen sound models to communicate information should however be further investigated.
