# Sound-augmented fabrics

This repository contains the code and information about the sound-augmented fabric prototypes that have been developed in the context of the Sounds for Energy project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The project led to the following publications:

> Vincenzo Madaghiele, Arife Dila Demir, Sandra Pauletto.
> [**Heat-sensitive sonic textiles: increasing awareness of the energy we save by wearing warm fabrics**]().
> In _Proceedings of Sound and Music Computing Conference 2023_, June 12-17 2023, Stockholm (SE).


> Vincenzo Madaghiele, Sandra Pauletto.
> [**Experimenting techniques for sonic implicit interactions: a real time sonification of body-textile heat exchange with sound augmented fabrics**](https://zenodo.org/record/7243805#.Y1Z0FlJBy3I).
> In _Proceedings of 2nd Conference on Sonification of Health and Environmental Data (SoniHED)_, October 27-28 2022, Stockholm (SE).
